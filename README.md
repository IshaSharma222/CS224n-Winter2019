# CS224n-Winter2019

These are my solutions to the practical assignments of [CS224n (Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning)](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs224n/cs224n.1194/) offered by Stanford University in Winter 2019. 
I am not enrolled in this course. I am currently taking it online and regularly watching the lecture videos, reading the suggested material and completing the given assignments.
# What is this course about?
Natural language processing (NLP) is one of the most important technologies of the information age, and a crucial part of artificial intelligence. Applications of NLP are everywhere because people communicate almost everything in language: web search, advertising, emails, customer service, language translation, virtual agents, medical reports, etc. In recent years, Deep Learning approaches have obtained very high performance across many different NLP tasks, using single end-to-end neural models that do not require traditional, task-specific feature engineering. In this course, students will gain a thorough introduction to cutting-edge research in Deep Learning for NLP. Through lectures, assignments and a final project, students will learn the necessary skills to design, implement, and understand their own neural network models. This year, CS224n will be taught for the first time using PyTorch rather than TensorFlow (as in previous years).
